This is my first ever published program. It is meant to be used for ethical hacking purposes. It is for a dictionary password cracking attempt. It supplies a text document filled
with over 32 million possible password combinations that start with a name that you give it. For example, if you input a name such as Ashley it will output 32 million possible
password combinations starting with Ashley. This includes Ashley39840$, Ashley1, Ashley00032, Ashley0042849@, etc. It is compatible with tools such as hydra for online passward
cracking and hashcat for offline password cracking. Those are the biggest examples but it is also compatible with any tool that requires a text document to crack a password.
